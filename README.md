# NRMetricFramework

NRMetricFramework is an open software framework for collaborative development of No Reference (NR) metrics for Image Quality Analysis (IQA) and Video Quality Analysis (VQA). This framework includes the support tools necessary to begin research and avoid common mistakes. The vision is a series of NR-VQA metrics that build upon each other to industry requirements for scope, accuracy, and capability.
